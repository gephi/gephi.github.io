<p><b>GDPR</b></p>
<p>Our software is designed to operate entirely on your local desktop environment and does not interact with any web servers or external data sources. As such, it does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Given this architecture, our software is inherently compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), as it does not engage in any data processing activities that fall under the scope of the regulation. Users can rest assured that their privacy is fully protected while using our software.</p>
<p>The only notable exception are bug reports. When Gephi encounters an error, we prompt the user to send the bug report to us. This report is sent to our <a href="https://sentry.io/organizations/gephi/issues/?project=85815" target="_blank">Sentry</a> account for collection. Before sending the report, we remove all possible PII from it, such as the username. Sending bug reports is entirely optional. No user data is sent as part of the report, only the application logs.</p>
