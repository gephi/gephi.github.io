<h2>Gephi</h2>
Gephi is an open-source software for network visualization and analysis. It helps data analysts to intuitively reveal patterns and trends, highlight outliers and tells stories with their data. It uses a 3D render engine to display large graphs in real-time and to speed up the exploration. Gephi combines built-in functionalities and flexible architecture to:
<ul>
    <li>explore</li>
    <li>analyze</li>
    <li>spatialize</li>
    <li>filter</li>
    <li>cluster</li>
    <li>manipulate</li>
    <li>export</li>
</ul>
all types of networks.

<p>Gephi is based on a visualize-and-manipulate paradigm which allow any user to discover networks and data properties. Moreover, it is designed to follow the chain of a case study, from data file to nice printable maps.</p>

<p>Gephi is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free/libre software</a> distributed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL 3</a> ("GNU General Public License").</p>

<h2>The Gephi Consortium</h2>
<p>The Gephi Consortium is a legal entity created to ensure future developments of Gephi by collecting funds and in-kind contributions to the members. It makes an R&D effort to build generic and reusable parts of Gephi, improve a competitive technology at low cost, and create standards to ensure interoperability. <a href="https://consortium.gephi.org/">Learn more.</a></p>

<h2>About Network Science</h2>

<p>Network Science is a new and emerging scientific discipline that examines the interconnections among diverse physical, informational, biological, cognitive, and social networks. This field of science seeks to discover common principles, algorithms and tools that govern network behavior. The National Research Council defines Network Science as "the organized knowledge of networks based on their study using the scientific method." In this context, network visualization brings a complementary way to statistical analysis to discover, extract and classify new patterns in network structure and data.</p>
