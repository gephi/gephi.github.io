<p>Gephi is a cross-platform application, as it is developed in Java. It was successfully tested on many different architecture, OS and graphical configuration. Gephi requires Java version 7 and later, get it <a href="http://www.java.com/getjava">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Minimum hardware requirements</h3>
<p>500 MHz CPU + 128 MB RAM + OpenGL 1.2<br />
There is no absolute minimum. This is a practical minimum. Performance is a function of graph size.</p>

<p>Note that Gephi has been successfully tested on Netbooks, running on Intel® Atom.</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>
<p>Gephi uses an OpenGL 3D engine to speed up graph visualization. However a compatible graphic card is required. If your graphic card is older than 8 years, or if your laptop doesn&#8217;t have a dedicated graphic card, you may have to upgrade your hardware to run Gephi.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;re running on Linux, get latest vendor graphical drivers to ensure OpenGL hardware acceleration.</p>

<h3>Java</h3>
The current stable version of Gephi will only run with Java 7 or 8. On Mac OS X, Java is bundled with the application so it doesn't have to be installed separately. On Windows and Linux, the system must be equipped with Java.
