<p>Gephi takes its performance by using 3D rendering and applying video games techniques in its built-in graph visualization&nbsp; engine. Therefore some issues could happen on particular hardware and/or configuration. This page helps you to gather information and solve problems.</p>
<h3>Gather information</h3>
<p>Before looking for getting more information, there are the different issues you could encounter. Try to choose one.</p>
<p>* Gephi crash immediately at startup. No error message before.</p>
<p>* The graph isn’t showed correctly, I have some graphical artifacts.</p>
<p>* The program window have graphical problems, the text is weird.</p>
<p>* The graph window stays white.</p>
<p>* The complete Gephi window doesn’t work and makes my computer freeze.</p>
<p>* The graph rendering is working but not showing texts.</p>
<h4>Graphic card model</h4>
<p>Because some of the possible issues are due to a graphic card problem, it is important to know what model you dispose. The Gephi application log usually contain this information. You can copy the following information:<br>
* OS<br>
* OpenGL version<br>
* Vendor<br>
* Renderer</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>First be sure you have the latest graphic card drivers installed. This may fix some issues and sometimes increase significantly performances.</p>
<p>If you can’t find an answer to your problem here, please report your problem on the <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues">GitHub</a> with the following information<br>
* Gephi version<br>
* Operating system, if you know the architecture (32/64 bits) let us know.<br>
* Details gathered from the online test. Graphic card vendor, model and OpenGL version.<br>
* If possible graphic card drivers version.</p>
<h4>Gephi crash immediately at startup. No error message before.</h4>
<p>This is a graphical crash, a log file should have been generated in the Gephi directory. Please attach it to the email you send to us.</p>
<h4>The graph isn’t showed correctly, I have some graphical artifacts</h4>
<p>Upgrade your graphic card drivers. IF it doesn’t fix the problem send us an email.</p>
<h4>The graph window stays white white white.</h4>
<p>Please report the issue on <a href="https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues">GitHub</a> with the required details.</p>
<h4>The graph rendering is working but not showing texts</h4>
<p>Your graphic card doesn’t support OpenGL 1.5 and so text rendering is not working. This may be fixed in the future.</p>
